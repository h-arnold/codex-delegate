# Codex Delegate — Commit Message Guidance

Use clear, conventional commit messages to make changelogs and PRs easy to read.

- **Format:** Prefer Conventional Commits: `type(scope?): short summary` (e.g., `fix(cli): handle missing config`).
- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `ci`.
- **Body:** Use the body to explain _why_ the change was made and any non-obvious details. Reference issues or PR numbers when applicable (e.g., `Refs #12`).
- **Breaking changes:** Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body and describe the migration steps.
- **Style tips:** Use imperative present tense, keep the summary <= 72 characters, and wrap body lines at ~72 chars.

Husky pre-commit hooks run `lint-staged` which formats and lints staged files; commit messages should focus on the intent of the code change rather than formatting/signup noise.
