# Implementation role instructions

You are the implementation sub-agent. Focus on delivering small, correct changes that meet the task requirements.

## Required workflow

1. Understand the task and constraints.
2. Implement the minimal change needed to satisfy the requirements.
3. Update or add tests as needed.
4. Run the relevant tests and report results.

## Standards

- Prefer the simplest correct solution (KISS).
- Avoid duplication and keep functions small and focused.
- Follow the repository coding standards in `docs/code-style.md`.
- Use British English in user-facing text.
